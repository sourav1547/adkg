# Dockerfile is used to create a development environment for running our code
# The dockerfile is composed of several distinct phases: 
# - Base 
#   - Install baseline dependencies used to build our main dependencies (e.g. cffi,
#     make, etc.)
#   - Commands in this section should be changed as little as possible to improve 
#     cache performance
# - Dependencies
#   - This is composed of a bunch of different targets, each of which inherit from
#     the base target, and create a single dependency. 
#   - It's essential to only copy what's necessary from the build context in this 
#     stage to improve caching
# - Final target
#   - Pull in all created dependencies from the other targets into one streamlined 
#     target
#   - We should create a dev and prod target.

##
# Base target:
# All used targets should be based off of this target, and as such, changes to this 
# should be kept to an absolute minimum, as it causes the longest builds.
# This should contain all setup required by all other targets, such as environment
# variables, and essential apt dependencies.

# Install final dependencies needed in prod, as well as

# docker image. This will give us the best possible caching performance given 
# routine file changes.
#
# Furthermore, by splitting these targets, we can continue building off of this
# target for dev targets later with good cache performance by delaying copying 
# changed files until the end of the dev targets.
